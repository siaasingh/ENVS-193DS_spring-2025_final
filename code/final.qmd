Problem 1 
a. a. Transparent Statistical Methods
Part 1: The author used a correlation test, likely Pearson’s correlation, to evaluate the 
relationship between distance from the headwater and total nitrogen load. This is implied by the phrasing “correlation” and the numeric p-value. The author used an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to 
compare the mean nitrogen loads between different sources (urban land, atmospheric deposition, fertilizer, wastewater treatment, and grasslands), as indicated by the reference to 
“average nitrogen load” and the overall p-value for group differences.

b. Descriptive Statistics by Source: Including means and standard deviations for nitrogen 
load by each source category would give readers a clearer picture of how nitrogen contributions 
differ across land use types.Sample Size per Source: Providing the number of observations 
per nitrogen source would help readers understand the reliability of the ANOVA results. 
For example, if one group had a very small sample size, its contribution to the test outcome 
might be questionable.

c. Nitrogen load increased with distance from the headwater, suggesting a spatial accumulation effect along the river. A correlation test was used to assess this relationship 
(test: Pearson’s correlation; r = [correlation coefficient], p = 0.03, α = 0.05).
There were statistically significant differences in nitrogen load among the five source categories, suggesting that some sources contribute disproportionately to nitrogen levels in the delta. 
An ANOVA was used to compare group means (test: ANOVA; F = [test statistic], df = 
[degrees of freedom], p = 0.02, α = 0.05).
